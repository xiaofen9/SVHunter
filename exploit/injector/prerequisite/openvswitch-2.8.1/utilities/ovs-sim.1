\fBovs\-sim\fR [\fIoption\fR]\[char46]\[char46]\[char46] [\fIscript\fR]\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.PP
\fBovs\-sim\fR provides a convenient environment for running one or more Open vSwitch instances and related software in a sandboxed simulation environment\[char46]
.PP
.PP
To use \fBovs\-sim\fR, first build Open vSwitch, then invoke it directly from the build directory, e\[char46]g\[char46]:
.PP
.nf
\fB
.br
\fBgit clone https://github\[char46]com/openvswitch/ovs\[char46]git
.br
\fBcd ovs
.br
\fB\[char46]/configure
.br
\fBmake
.br
\fButilities/ovs\-sim
.br
\fB    \fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
When invoked in the most ordinary way as shown above, \fBovs\-sim\fR does the following:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Creates a directory \fBsandbox\fR as a subdirectory of the current directory (first destroying such a directory if it already exists) and \fBcd\fRs into that directory\[char46]
.IP 2. .25in
Installs all of the Open vSwitch manpages into a \fBman\fR subdirectory of \fBsandbox\fR and adjusts the \fBMANPATH\fR environment variable so that \fBman\fR and other manpage viewers can find them\[char46]
.IP 3. .25in
Creates a simulated Open vSwitch named \fBmain\fR and sets it up as the default target for OVS commands, as if the following \fBovs\-sim\fR commands had been run:
.IP
.nf
\fB
.br
\fB          sim_add main
.br
\fB          as main
.br
\fB        \fR
.fi
.IP
See \fBCommands\fR, below, for an explanation\[char46]
.IP 4. .25in
Runs any scripts specified on the command line (see \fBOptions\fR below)\[char46] The scripts can use arbitrary Bash syntax, plus the additional commands described under \fBCommands\fR, below\[char46]
.IP 5. .25in
If no scripts were specified, or if \fB\-i\fR or \fB\-\-interactive\fR was specified, invokes an interactive Bash subshell\[char46] The user can use arbitrary Bash commands, plus the additional commands described under \fBCommands\fR, below\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
\fBovs\-sim\fR and the sandbox environment that it creates does not require superuser or other special privileges\[char46] Generally, it should not be run with such privileges\[char46]
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.PP
\fBovs\-sim\fR accepts the following options and arguments:
.RS
.TP
\fIscript\fR
Runs \fIscript\fR, which should be a Bash script, within a subshell after initializing\[char46] If multiple \fIscript\fR arguments are given, then they are run in the order given\[char46] If any \fIscript\fR exits with a nonzero exit code, then \fBovs\-sim\fR exits immediately with the same exit code\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-interactive\fR
By default, if any \fIscript\fR is specified, \fBovs\-sim\fR exits as soon as the scripts finish executing\[char46] With this option, or if no scripts are specified, \fBovs\-sim\fR instead starts an interactive Bash session\[char46]
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
.PP
Scripts and interactive usage may use the following commands implemented by \fBovs\-sim\fR\[char46] They are implemented as Bash shell functions exported to subshells\[char46]
.SS "Basic Commands"
.PP
.PP
These are the basic commands for working with sandboxed Open vSwitch instances\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBsim_add\fR \fIsandbox\fR
Starts a new simulated Open vSwitch instance named \fIsandbox\fR\[char46] Files related to the instance, such as logs, databases, sockets, and pidfiles, are created in a subdirectory also named \fIsandbox\fR\[char46] Afterward, the \fBas\fR command (see below) can be used to run Open vSwitch utilities in the context of the new sandbox\[char46]
.IP
The new sandbox starts out without any bridges\[char46] Use \fBovs\-vsctl\fR in the context of the new sandbox to create a bridge, e\[char46]g\[char46]:
.IP
.nf
\fB
.br
\fBsim_add hv0           # Create sandbox hv0\[char46]
.br
\fBas hv0                # Set hv0 as default sandbox\[char46]
.br
\fBovs\-vsctl add\-br br0  # Add bridge br0 inside hv0\[char46]
.br
\fB        \fR
.fi
.IP
The Open vSwitch instances that \fBsim_add\fR create enable ``dummy\(cq\(cq devices\[char46] This means that bridges and interfaces can be created with type \fBdummy\fR to indicate that they should be totally simulated, without any reference to system entities\[char46] In fact, \fBovs\-sim\fR also configures Open vSwitch so that the default \fBsystem\fR type of bridges and interfaces are replaced by \fBdummy\fR devices\[char46] Other types of devices, however, retain their usual functions, which means that, e\[char46]g\[char46], \fBvxlan\fR tunnels still act as tunnels (refer to the documentation)\[char46]
.TP
\fBas\fR \fIsandbox\fR
Sets \fIsandbox\fR as the default simulation target for Open vSwitch commands (e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBovs\-vsctl\fR, \fBovs\-ofctl\fR, \fBovs\-appctl\fR)\[char46]
.IP
This command updates the beginning of the shell prompt to indicate the new default target\[char46]
.TP
\fBas\fR \fIsandbox\fR \fIcommand\fR \fIarg\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Runs the given \fIcommand\fR with \fIsandbox\fR as the simulation target, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBas hv0 ovs\-vsctl add\-br br0\fR runs \fBovs\-vsctl add\-br br0\fR within sandbox \fBhv0\fR\[char46] The default target is unchanged\[char46]
.RE
.SS "Interconnection Network Commands"
.PP
.PP
When multiple sandboxed Open vSwitch instances exist, one will inevitably want to connect them together\[char46] These commands allow for that\[char46] Conceptually, an interconnection network is a switch that \fBovs\-sim\fR makes it easy to plug into other switches in other sandboxed Open vSwitch instances\[char46] Interconnection networks are implemented as bridges in the \fBmain\fR switch that \fBovs\-sim\fR creates by default, so to use interconnection networks please avoid working with \fBmain\fR directly\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBnet_add\fR \fInetwork\fR
Creates a new interconnection network named \fInetwork\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBnet_attach\fR \fInetwork\fR \fIbridge\fR
Adds a new port to \fIbridge\fR in the default sandbox (as set with \fBas\fR) and plugs it into the \fInetwork\fR interconnection network\[char46] \fInetwork\fR must already have been created by a previous invocation of \fBnet_add\fR\[char46] The default sandbox must not be \fBmain\fR\[char46]
.RE
.SS "OVN Commands"
.PP
.PP
These commands interact with OVN, the Open Virtual Network\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBovn_start\fR
Creates and initializes the central OVN databases (both \fBovn\-sb\fR(5) and \fBovn\-nb\fR) and starts an instance of \fBovsdb\-server\fR for each one\[char46] Also starts an instance of \fBovn\-northd\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBovn_attach\fR \fInetwork\fR \fIbridge\fR \fIip\fR [\fImasklen\fR]
First, this command attaches \fIbridge\fR to interconnection network \fInetwork\fR, just like \fBnet_attach\fR \fInetwork\fR \fIbridge\fR\[char46] Second, it configures (simulated) IP address \fIip\fR (with network mask length \fBmasklen\fR, which defaults to 24) on \fIbridge\fR\[char46] Finally, it configures the Open vSwitch database to work with OVN and starts \fBovn\-controller\fR\[char46]
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
